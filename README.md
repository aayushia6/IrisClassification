# Iris Flower Classification Web App 🌸

This repository contains a Streamlit-based web application that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on user-provided measurements. The model is trained on the classic Iris dataset using a supervised machine learning algorithm.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This application allows users to enter sepal and petal measurements and receive an instant prediction of the Iris species (`Setosa`, `Versicolor`, or `Virginica`). It is designed for ease of use and serves as a simple demonstration of end-to-end machine learning deployment.
